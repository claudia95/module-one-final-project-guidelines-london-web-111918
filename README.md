## About

TechCrunch Top Ten was created by [claudia95](https://github.com/claudia95) and [ja9-look](https://github.com/ja9-look).
The TechCruch API was called using Ruby, to obtain the top 10 articles on the TechCrunch News webpage.
This is a live API that updates the articles regularly so that readers will get hot-off-the-press news.

## MVP

We wanted our app to fulfill the following MVPs:

1. User should be able to see the latest articles titles and authors
2. User should be able to have a brief overview of the latest articles
3. User should be able to see a unique list of authors
4. User should be able to see all articles under a specified author
5. User should be able to see the latest single article

## Stretch Goals

In order to further our app, we wanted to:

1. Ensure that the CLI is easy for the user to read
2. Implement emojis into the CLI
3. Use additional gems to make the app aesthetically pleasing
