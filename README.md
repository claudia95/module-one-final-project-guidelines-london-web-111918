##About
TechCrunch Top Ten is created by [claudia95](https://github.com/claudia95) and [ja9-look](https://github.com/ja9-look).
The TechCruch API was called using Ruby, to obtain the top 10 articles on the TechCrunch News webpage.
This is a live API that updates the articles regularly so that readers will get hot-off-the-press news.
